He will write a book
they shall throw a party 
She will go to university 
He will prepare a cake
He will walk in the park 
we shall learn a language 
I have visited this country 
I have watched this movie 
we have eaten the chocolate 
I had called to the office 
I had worked at the university 
He had learnt the language 
He is staying at home 
They are sitting in the park 
They are waiting in the hotel 
she is leaving to the office 
He is talking to the lawyer 
I will be watching the movie 
He will be eating the chocolate 
She will be learning the language
