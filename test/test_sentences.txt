either my mom or my dad takes care of my brother
she could either have one week abroad or two weeks at home
neither the cheesecake nor the chocolate cake is good
if i go to movie next time then i will buy popcorn
if it is her birthday today then she will throw a party
it was such an interesting story that I read it in one sitting
she is such a charming woman that everybody stares at her
it was such a difficult idea that it took time to understand
it was such a huge park that we walked for a long time
he told them both what to do and what not to do
he is either a nazi or a german for sure
he is going to do both reading and writing the book
neither my mom nor my dad works at the university
can you give me both car keys and house keys
you will find it either in the kitchen or in the bathroom
if he believes in god then he goes to church 
i am very fluent in both french and german 
either i will have some coffee or tea now
it is their choice to either beileve or not believe
neither me nor my brother can drive a car
